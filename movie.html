<h2><strong> The great Gatsby</strong></h2>
<p style="color:white">Genres : Drama</br>
Release Date: 13 July 1949 (USA) </br>
Stars: Alan Ladd, Betty Field, Macdonald Carey </br>
Short description : ALAN LADD was the perfect actor for THE GREAT GATSBY, and his performance in this film captures F. Scott Fitzgerald's tragic hero with every nuance, every movement, every hidden torment. Ladd wanted to do this role, although he had his anxieties (as was noted by my friend Geraldine Fitzgerald). Nonetheless, he succeeds splendidly as Gatsby - a definitive characterization that should be seen. Redford had the right stuff, to a large extent, but the Redford-Farrow version is far too overblown with far too many missing, and important, elements in the plot.</p>
